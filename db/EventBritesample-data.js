Together, they develop strategies whereby the individual(s) life can become more rewarding and productive. John received his Bachelor of Arts Degree in English Literature with a Minor in Speech and Communications from San Francisco State University. He then went on to complete his Master of Divinity in Theology from Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena.\nIn addition, John holds an M.A. Degree in Marriage and Family Counseling from Santa Clara University in Santa Clara, CA.

Previously he had worked in the private sector for 25 years as a Facilities Manager and the public sector for 10 years as the Superintendent of the County of Santa Clara: John and his wife Rosemary have been married for 38 years and have two adult daughters; Angelica and Ashley, and he and his wife are new grandparents to a baby girl.\nThe cost to attend this event is $25.00.

              "text": "THE WEB, THE BOOK, AND THE WALL: EXHIBITION STRATEGIESWard Long8 Sessions>> Thursdays, September 26- November 21(No class October 31)6:00PM-9:00pm, Studio 20B, $385\nPresenting your work across mediums is hard. Catalogs, installations, galleries, museums, books, zines, sites and feeds all have their own strengths and limitations, not to mention historical traditions and viewer expectations. Sometimes the book is fantastic but the prints are underwhelming, or show is transcendent but it looks so tedious in the pictures from the opening online. This class analyzes how the sensory experience of viewing an artwork affects how we understand the work itself. The goal is to give students the critical tools to be more thoughtful about the way they present work to potential viewers.\nOur first session will survey a number of contemporary artists, and discuss the ways that their work translates (or doesn’t) in specific venues. Does the photobook make sense on the wall? Is a vintage Stephen Shore picture interesting on Instagram? What changes when Zoe Strauss moves her prints from the freeway underpass and into the museum? Does this black and white photo document the conceptual piece, or does it replace it with the aura of the ephemeral and authentic? Later in the course, students will be asked to present and write about works by their favorite artists, and discuss in each case how the medium affects the way we see the work. Last, students will then act as curators, designing their own exhibitions, publications, and performances and discussing them through group critique.\n____Ward Long is a photographer living in Oakland, California. He received his MFA in Photography at the University of Hartford in 2015, and his undergraduate degree at Davidson College.\nHis pictures describe loss, people, and landscape, and the way all three are inexorably linked by memory. Combining literary precision and cinematic sweep, his projects blend personal storytelling with documentary realism. Much of his work takes shape as handmade books; recent titles have centered on longing for home and the fear you'll never find it, madness and used cars in Jacksonville, and swimming hole cliff in North Carolina.\nHe received a 2017 Beth Block grant from the Houston Center of Photography, has exhibited nationally, and his work has been featured in SPOT, Burn Magazine, C-41, and YET. He taught analog photography at the University of Hartford, has been a guest critic at the San Francisco Art Institute, and works as a fine art master printer. His self-published books have been exhibited at art fairs and shows across the country, and are in the collections of the University of Virginia, the University of Hartford, and Pier 24 Photography.\nhttp://www.wardlong.com/ \n\nPLEASE NOTE: Public Education courses are held contingent on a minimum enrollment, which is determined two business days prior to a class start date. Public Education Staff will contact you ONLY if there is a course cancellation or change. \n\nFAQs\nWhat materials (if any) will I need to bring to class?Each course requires specific materials that we ask you bring to your first class session so you can get started making right away. Materials lists are available approximately two weeks prior to the course start date. Visit the SFAI website here, click on your course title, and then click on the blue \"Materials List\" link underneath the course dates. If you have any questions regarding materials, please contact Public Education Staff.What are my transport/parking options getting to San Francisco Art Institute?All classes, unless otherwise noted, meet at 800 Chestnut Street, between Jones and Leavenworth. You can find directions to campus on the SFAI website.\nSFAI is located in a residential neighborhood, and free two-hour parking is available on all of the streets immediately surrounding the school.

Catalogs, installations, galleries, museums, books, zines, sites and feeds all have their own strengths and limitations, not to mention historical traditions and viewer expectations. Sometimes the book is fantastic but the prints are underwhelming, or show is transcendent but it looks so tedious in the pictures from the opening online. This class analyzes how the sensory experience of viewing an artwork affects how we understand the work itself. The goal is to give students the critical tools to be more thoughtful about the way they present work to potential viewers.</SPAN></P>\n<P>Our first session will survey a number of contemporary artists, and discuss the ways that their work translates (or doesn’t) in specific venues. Does the photobook make sense on the wall? Is a vintage Stephen Shore picture interesting on Instagram? What changes when Zoe Strauss moves her prints from the freeway underpass and into the museum? Does this black and white photo document the conceptual piece, or does it replace it with the aura of the ephemeral and authentic? Later in the course, students will be asked to present and write about works by their favorite artists, and discuss in each case how the medium affects the way we see the work. Last, students will then act as curators, designing their own exhibitions, publications, and performances and discussing them through group critique.</P>\n<P><SPAN>____<BR></SPAN><STRONG>Ward Long</STRONG> is a photographer living in Oakland, California. He received his MFA in Photography at the University of Hartford in 2015, and his undergraduate degree at Davidson College.</P>\n<P>His pictures describe loss, people, and landscape, and the way all three are inexorably linked by memory. Combining literary precision and cinematic sweep, his projects blend personal storytelling with documentary realism. Much of his work takes shape as handmade books; recent titles have centered on longing for home and the fear you'll never find it, madness and used cars in Jacksonville, and swimming hole cliff in North Carolina.</P>\n<P><SPAN><SPAN>He received a 2017 Beth Block grant from the Houston Center of Photography, has exhibited nationally, and his work has been featured in SPOT, Burn Magazine, C-41, and YET. He taught analog photography at the University of Hartford, has been a guest critic at the San Francisco Art Institute, and works as a fine art master printer. His self-published books have been exhibited at art fairs and shows across the country, and are in the collections of the University of Virginia, the University of Hartford, and Pier 24 Photography.</SPAN></SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN><A HREF=\"http://www.wardlong.com/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><SPAN>http://www.wardlong.com/</SPAN></A><SPAN> </SPAN></SPAN></P>\n<HR>\n<P><STRONG><EM>PLEASE NOTE: Public Education courses are held contingent on a minimum enrollment, which is determined two business days prior to a class start date.

Doors open at 7:30pm with full cash bar upstairs and downstairs. The evening will also be the launch of James’ (small) book published by Monocle Publishing titled “Beyond Coffee: A Sustainable Guide to Nootropics, Adaptogens, and Mushrooms”. A book that has nothing to do with founding, investing, or podcasting about startups :P, but everything to do with James’ passion of encouraging people to mindfully create. More details below. More on the live recording: Our first discussion kicked off the Below The Line podcast — a conversational podcast on the nature, psychology, and reality of creation — and this live recording will go deeper into what has shaped Justin as person. Featuring founders, artists, musicians, creators, and leaders as they explore what happens below the surface and illuminate the inner journey of creating something new, Below The Line has racked up over 50,000 downloads in the first few months of production and has been featured by Apple, Breaker, SmashNotes, and PodcastNotes.org as one of the top new startup—focused podcasts of 2019.More on the book: It’s common sense among the public at large that coffee and tea can help with productivity and alertness. It’s also common sense among top researchers that nature gives us a number of other natural ingredients which do amazing things like improve memory (bacopa monnieri), improve creative/lateral thinking (choline found in eggs), decrease stress and anxiety which impede our productivity (l-theanine and ashwagandha), and do amazing things like limit the spikes and plunges of blood sugar that can knock us out after lunch (chaga mushrooms). Discover which ingredients can be easily, safely, and effectively taken alongside your morning ritual for more productivity and less stress with James’ new, short book with over 240 scientific studies cited that demystifies and simplifies a nutritional space that we’re collectively starting to pay attention to: “Beyond Coffee: A Sustainable Guide to Nootropics, Adaptogens, and Mushrooms”.",

              "text": "Empathy is good for society, but did you also know it's good for your business?\nJoin us for this lively panel and author Q&A, led by brand strategist and speaker, Maria Ross, author of the new book, The Empathy Edge: Harnessing the Value of Compassion as an Engine for Success (A Playbook for Brands, Leaders, and Teams). Maria will share her illuminating research and case studies that prove how empathy can be a competitive advantage. She will then be joined by Montcalm CEO and founder Holly Ruxin and HINT, Inc CEO and founder, Kara Goldin to discuss the role empathy plays in their leadership styles and company culture, what role it plays in capital market success, and how that mindset has attracted the right clients, boosted customer loyalty, and impacted the bottom line. You will leave with practical action steps you can take now to flex your empathy muscles as a leader, culture, and brand. \nIf we can master empathy in the place where we spend the bulk of our time (work), then there's hope that such compassion can spill over into our wider culture and society.\nDrinks and light nibbles provides. Book signing will take place after the program. Come early to mingle, nosh and network!\nEVENT PROGRAM:\n6:00 pm to 6:30 pm: Mingling/Networking\n6:30 pm to 6:40 pm: Short presentation and book reading by Maria Ross\n6:40 pm to 7:30 pm: Panel discussion and audience Q&A\n7:30 pm to 8:00 pm: Book signing and further conversation\nStreet parking or public lots available. Also walking distance from Civic Center BART or several bus lines.\nYOUR SPEAKERS:\nMaria Ross, Founder, Red Slice, speaker and author, The Empathy Edge\nMaria Ross, the founder of brand consultancy Red Slice, believes cash flow, creativity and compassion are not mutually exclusive. She advises entrepreneurs and fast-growth business on building irresistible brand stories and messaging to better connect with customers. Maria has authored multiple books, including The Empathy Edge and Branding Basics for Small Business.

Jami will be joined in conversation with author Rachel Khong, author of Goodbye, Vitamin, followed by casual audience question-and-answer session. Jami is the author of six books: Instant Love, The Kept Man, The Melting Season, New York Times bestseller The Middlesteins, Saint Mazie, and national bestseller All Grown Up, which was published in March 2017 in the US and the UK, and in Italy, Germany, France, Holland, Poland, Russia, China, the Czech Republic, Turkey, Portugal and Hungary in 2018. Her seventh book, All This Could Be Yours, will be published on October 22, 2019. \nThe Ruby is an arts & letters–focused work and gathering space for creative Bay Area women of all definitions. The Ruby's Writer in Residence program seeks to support the best writers writing, and to bring writers from outside the Bay Area to The Ruby to read. Writers in residence stay in our upstairs writers loft. \n***Ruby members, thanks to HMH, the first of you to sign up will get a free copy of All This Could Be Yours (while supplies last!)\n\nAbout ALL THIS COULD BE YOURS: From critically acclaimed New York Times best-selling author Jami Attenberg comes a novel of family secrets: think the drama of Big Little Lies set in the heat of a New Orleans summer\n“If I know why they are the way they are, then maybe I can learn why I am the way I am,” says Alex Tuchman of her parents. Now that her father is on his deathbed, Alex—a strong-headed lawyer, devoted mother, and loving sister--feels she can finally unearth the secrets of who Victor is and what he did over the course of his life and career. (A power-hungry real estate developer, he is, by all accounts, a bad man.) She travels to New Orleans to be with her family, but mostly to interrogate her tightlipped mother, Barbra.\nAs Barbra fends off Alex’s unrelenting questions, she reflects on her tumultuous life with Victor. Meanwhile Gary, Alex’s brother, is incommunicado, trying to get his movie career off the ground in Los Angeles. And Gary’s wife, Twyla, is having a nervous breakdown, buying up all the lipstick in drug stores around New Orleans and bursting into crying fits. Dysfunction is at its peak. As each family member grapples with Victor’s history, they must figure out a way to move forward—with one another, for themselves, and for the sake of their children.\nALL THIS COULD BE YOURS is a timely, piercing exploration of what it means to be caught in the web of a toxic man who abused his power; it shows how those webs can tangle a family for generations and what it takes to—maybe, hopefully—break free. With her signature “sparkling prose” (Marie Claire) and incisive wit, Jami Attenberg deftly explores one of the most important subjects of our age.",

His books include longtime Archive favorite French Fries (1984) and are widely acclaimed for capturing the shape of thought and reuniting the traditions of storytelling.\n\nLehrer will survey his journey as a writer, designer, performer, and practitioner of visual literature, including several collaborations with investigative journalist and author Dennis J Bernstein, host of KPFA's Flashpoints. Bernstein will then join Lehrer to present their new book and multimedia project, Five Oceans in a Teaspoon. A collection of short visual poems divided into 8 movements, the 300-page book sits at the center of a multi-tiered project that includes typographic animations, a traveling exhibit, and performance/readings.\n\nCopies of Five Oceans in a Teaspoon will be available for sale at the event.
