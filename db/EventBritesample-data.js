Catalogs, installations, galleries, museums, books, zines, sites and feeds all have their own strengths and limitations, not to mention historical traditions and viewer expectations. Sometimes the book is fantastic but the prints are underwhelming, or show is transcendent but it looks so tedious in the pictures from the opening online. This class analyzes how the sensory experience of viewing an artwork affects how we understand the work itself. The goal is to give students the critical tools to be more thoughtful about the way they present work to potential viewers.\nOur first session will survey a number of contemporary artists, and discuss the ways that their work translates (or doesn’t) in specific venues. Does the photobook make sense on the wall? Is a vintage Stephen Shore picture interesting on Instagram? What changes when Zoe Strauss moves her prints from the freeway underpass and into the museum? Does this black and white photo document the conceptual piece, or does it replace it with the aura of the ephemeral and authentic? Later in the course, students will be asked to present and write about works by their favorite artists, and discuss in each case how the medium affects the way we see the work. Last, students will then act as curators, designing their own exhibitions, publications, and performances and discussing them through group critique.\n____Ward Long is a photographer living in Oakland, California. He received his MFA in Photography at the University of Hartford in 2015, and his undergraduate degree at Davidson College.\nHis pictures describe loss, people, and landscape, and the way all three are inexorably linked by memory. Combining literary precision and cinematic sweep, his projects blend personal storytelling with documentary realism. Much of his work takes shape as handmade books; recent titles have centered on longing for home and the fear you'll never find it, madness and used cars in Jacksonville, and swimming hole cliff in North Carolina.\nHe received a 2017 Beth Block grant from the Houston Center of Photography, has exhibited nationally, and his work has been featured in SPOT, Burn Magazine, C-41, and YET. He taught analog photography at the University of Hartford, has been a guest critic at the San Francisco Art Institute, and works as a fine art master printer. His self-published books have been exhibited at art fairs and shows across the country, and are in the collections of the University of Virginia, the University of Hartford, and Pier 24 Photography.\nhttp://www.wardlong.com/ \n\nPLEASE NOTE: Public Education courses are held contingent on a minimum enrollment, which is determined two business days prior to a class start date.

Jami will be joined in conversation with author Rachel Khong, author of Goodbye, Vitamin, followed by casual audience question-and-answer session. Jami is the author of six books: Instant Love, The Kept Man, The Melting Season, New York Times bestseller The Middlesteins, Saint Mazie, and national bestseller All Grown Up, which was published in March 2017 in the US and the UK, and in Italy, Germany, France, Holland, Poland, Russia, China, the Czech Republic, Turkey, Portugal and Hungary in 2018. Her seventh book, All This Could Be Yours, will be published on October 22, 2019. \nThe Ruby is an arts & letters–focused work and gathering space for creative Bay Area women of all definitions. The Ruby's Writer in Residence program seeks to support the best writers writing, and to bring writers from outside the Bay Area to The Ruby to read. Writers in residence stay in our upstairs writers loft. \n***Ruby members, thanks to HMH, the first of you to sign up will get a free copy of All This Could Be Yours (while supplies last!)\n\nAbout ALL THIS COULD BE YOURS: From critically acclaimed New York Times best-selling author Jami Attenberg comes a novel of family secrets: think the drama of Big Little Lies set in the heat of a New Orleans summer\n“If I know why they are the way they are, then maybe I can learn why I am the way I am,” says Alex Tuchman of her parents. Now that her father is on his deathbed, Alex—a strong-headed lawyer, devoted mother, and loving sister--feels she can finally unearth the secrets of who Victor is and what he did over the course of his life and career. (A power-hungry real estate developer, he is, by all accounts, a bad man.) She travels to New Orleans to be with her family, but mostly to interrogate her tightlipped mother, Barbra.\nAs Barbra fends off Alex’s unrelenting questions, she reflects on her tumultuous life with Victor. Meanwhile Gary, Alex’s brother, is incommunicado, trying to get his movie career off the ground in Los Angeles. And Gary’s wife, Twyla, is having a nervous breakdown, buying up all the lipstick in drug stores around New Orleans and bursting into crying fits. Dysfunction is at its peak. As each family member grapples with Victor’s history, they must figure out a way to move forward—with one another, for themselves, and for the sake of their children.\nALL THIS COULD BE YOURS is a timely, piercing exploration of what it means to be caught in the web of a toxic man who abused his power; it shows how those webs can tangle a family for generations and what it takes to—maybe, hopefully—break free. With her signature “sparkling prose” (Marie Claire) and incisive wit, Jami Attenberg deftly explores one of the most important subjects of our age.",

What is it about the songbook of Bob Dylan that continues to captivate our deeper yearnings for meaning and hope in a world so dark and broken? While Dylan’s songbook has been analyzed in numerous studies, whether as classical literature, as scriptural theology, as mystical prophesy, or as the musings of a Zen master, the present study, God Knows Everything is Broken, aims to be a “generative” exploration of the depth and breadth of Dylan’s songbook in as of yet unexplored registers by examining the uniquely cynical but coherent gnostic theology within the arc of his lyrics. What continues to be underappreciated is how Dylan’s great American songbook—both in his original songwriting as well as covers— expresses a relentlessly downbeat world weariness as a way of navigating a world unworthy of complete redemption. By reflecting on this Nobel Laureate’s deft intertextuality that creates a new American scripture, God Knows Everything is Broken draws together the constellations of creative cataclysms in Dylan’s songbook as a uniquely dark expression of what he refers to in “Desolation Row” as Ophelia’s religion— that is, nothing but purest of American Religion. Dylan’s songbook is a playful but profound, catchy but nuanced trajectory into deeper darkening constellations of love lost, time unredeemed and faith broken. By reading Dylan’s American songbook as gnostic is to problematize the tendency to pigeon-hole one who is “busy being born” over five decades not as being “born-again” into Christianity, or “returning” to Judaism, but as a master of masks being designed, dawned and discarded in a series of creative cataclysms that continue to take hold of our imagination through iconoclastic lyricism. Dylan’s songbook is a testament to a constancy in creative rebirthing that mirrors the cosmos itself amidst its brokenness. God Knows Everything is Broken uncovers Dylan’s meandering direction home in his singularly ingenious gnostic songbook that opens a new window in to the death and rebirth of the American Dream.\nDONATIONS AND SPONSORSHIPS FOR FORTHCOMING MUSICAL BOOK PROJECTS THROUGH PANUI ON LOU REED AND WILCO ARE WELCOME.",
